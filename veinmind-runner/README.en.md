<p align="center">
veinmind-runner it's a container security host developed by Chaitin Technology.
</p>

## Introduce
With the background of rich R&D experience, the chaitin team designed a plug-in system in veinmind-sdk.
With the support of this plugin system, you only need to call the API provided by veinmind-sdk to automatically generate plugins that conform to standard specifications. (For specific code examples, see [example](./example))
As a plugin platform, `veinmind-runner` will automatically scan the plugins that conform to the specification, and pass the image information that needs to be scanned to the corresponding plugins.

## Feature

- Automatically scan and register plugins in the current directory (including subdirectories)
- Unified operation of plug-ins implemented in different languages
- Plugins can communicate with `runner`, such as reporting events for alarming, etc.

## Compatibility

- linux/amd64
- linux/386
- linux/arm64
- linux/arm

## Install

### Install by package manager

please install `libveinmind`，here is [official document](https://github.com/chaitin/libveinmind)

you can compile manually `veinmind-runner`，
or download from [Release](https://github.com/chaitin/veinmind-tools/releases)

### Install by parallel container

based on the parallel container mode, get the image of `veinmind-runner` and start it
```
docker run --rm -it --mount 'type=bind,source=/,target=/host,readonly,bind-propagation=rslave' \
-v `pwd`:/tool/resource -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock veinmind/veinmind-runner
```

or use the script provided by the project to start
```
chmod +x parallel-container-run.sh && ./parallel-container-run.sh
```

### Install by Helm

based on `Kubernetes` environment, use `Helm` to install `veinmind-runner`，run scan tasks regularly

Please install `Helm` first, the installation method can refer to the [official document](https://helm.sh/zh/docs/intro/install/)

Before installing `veinmind-runner`, please configure the running parameters, please refer to the [document](https://github.com/chaitin/veinmind-tools/blob/master/veinmind-runner/script/helm_chart/README.en.md)

Install `veinmind-runner` with `Helm`

```
cd ./veinmind-runner/script/helm_chart/veinmind
helm install veinmind .
```

## Usage

1.specify the image name or image ID and scan (need to have a corresponding image locally)

```
./veinmind-runner scan-host image [imagename/imageid]
```

2.scan all local images

```
./veinmind-runner scan-host image
```


3.scan all local containers

```
./veinmind-runner scan-host container
```

4.scan local iac file

```
./veinmind-runner scan-iac local ./
./veinmind-runner scan-iac local /path/to/iac-file
```

5.scan IaC file in remote git repository

```
./veinmind-runner scan-iac git http://xxxxxx.git 
# auth
./veinmind-runner scan-iac git git@xxxxxx --sshkey=/your/ssh/key/path
./veinmind-runner scan-iac git http://{username}:password@xxxxxx.git
# add proxy
./veinmind-runner scan-iac git http://xxxxxx.git --proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8080
./veinmind-runner scan-iac git http://xxxxxx.git --proxy=scoks5://127.0.0.1:8080
# disable tls
./veinmind-runner scan-iac git http://xxxxxx.git --insecure-skip=true
```

6.scan remote kubernetes IaC config(needs kubeconfig file)
```
./veinmind-runner scan-iac k8s --kubeconfig=/your/k8sConfig/path
```

7.scan the `centos` image in the remote repository (the default is `index.docker.io` if the repository is not specified)

```
./veinmind-runner scan-registry image centos
```

8.scan `registry.private.net/library/nginx` image in the remote private registry, where `auth.toml` is the authentication information configuration file, which contains the corresponding authentication information

```
./veinmind-runner scan-registry image -c auth.toml registry.private.net/library/nginx
```

the format of `auth.toml` is as follows, `registry` represents the repository address, `username` represents the username, `password` represents the password or token
```
[[auths]]
	registry = "index.docker.io"
	username = "admin"
	password = "password"
[[auths]]
	registry = "registry.private.net"
	username = "admin"
	password = "password"
```

9.specify the container runtime type

```
./veinmind-runner scan-host image --containerd
```

container runtime type
- dockerd
- containerd

10.filtering with `glob` requires running the plugin
```
./veinmind-runner scan-host image -g "**/veinmind-malicious"
```

11.list plugin
```
./veinmind-runner list plugin
```

12.specify the container runtime path
```
./veinmind-runner scan-host image --docker-data-root [your_path]
```
```
./veinmind-runner scan-host image --containerd-root [your_path]
```

13.support docker plugin for authorization
```bash
# first
./veinmind-runner authz -c config.toml
# second
dockerd --authorization-plugin=veinmind-broker
```
Field in `config.toml`

|  | **name**           | **attribute** | **meaning**  |
|----------|-------------------|----------|---------|
| policy   | action            | string   | action should be monitored |
|          | enabled_plugins   | []string | which plugins to use
|
|          | plugin_params     | []string | parameters for each plugin |
|          | risk_level_filter | []string | risk level    |
|          | block             | bool     | whether to block    |
|          | alert             | bool     | whether to alert    |
| log      | report_log_path   | string   | log for veinmind plugins  |
|          | authz_log_path    | string   | log for docker plugin  |

- action supports [DockerAPI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.41/#operation/) provided operation interface
- The following configuration means: when `create a container`or`push a image`, use the `veinmind-weakpass` plugin to scan the `ssh` service, if a weak password is found, and the risk level is `High`, block this operation, and issue a warning. Finally, the scan results are stored in `plugin.log`, and the risk results are stored in `auth.log`.

```toml
[log]
plugin_log_path = "plugin.log"
auth_log_path = "auth.log"
[listener]
listener_addr = "/run/docker/plugins/veinmind-broker.sock"
[[policies]]
action = "container_create"
enabled_plugins = ["veinmind-weakpass"]

[[policies]]
action = "image_push"
enabled_plugins = ["veinmind-weakpass"]
plugin_params = ["veinmind-weakpass:scan.serviceName=ssh"]
